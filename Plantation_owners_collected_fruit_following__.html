<p>Plantation owners collected fruit following their normal schedule and at collection the fruit was weighed to gain an estimate of yield. Yield measurements continued throughout the experiment and six months after exclusion ended. A number of palms in the experimental plots had not started being harvested at the beginning of our experiment, and it is likely there would be delay for any treatment effects on yield, therefore, we calculated four yield measurements for each tree to be included in our analysis: total yield over the complete 18 months (18m yield), total yield divided by time harvested (18m yield/time), total yield but with a six month delay (12m yield) and total yield with six month delay divided by time harvested (12m yield/time). A six month delay was chosen due to oil palm having 5-6 months between flowering and yield (Verheye 2010).</p><div></div>
