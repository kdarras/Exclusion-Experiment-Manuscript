<h1>Results</h1><p>Ant exclusion effectiveness</p><p>Average ant abundance over the year of the experiment was significantly lower in ant exclusion plots, whereas total species richness was not (Table Figure S2). However, community composition was significantly different between ant exclusion and non-ant exclusion plots (ANOSIM, P=0.04, R=0.11).</p><div></div>
