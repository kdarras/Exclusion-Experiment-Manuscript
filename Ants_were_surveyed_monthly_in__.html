<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ants were surveyed monthly in every experimental plot to monitor the effectiveness of the ant suppression methods. We used plastic observation plates with two baits of 2 cm3 of tuna in oil and two sponges saturated with 70% sugar solution attached to sample ant species (Wielgoss et al. 2010). Two plates were put in a random location on the ground in each experimental plot at each plantation. At 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes after placing the plates on the trees the abundance of each ant species present on the plate was recorded. Specimens were collected from each ant species present where possible without disrupting recruitment. All ants collected were identified to genus level (Fayle et al. 2014). We identified specimens to species level where possible and assigned the remainder to morphospecies. Ant species abundance at a given plot each month was defined as the mean of the maximum number of each species on each plate used at an exclusion plot.</p><div></div>
