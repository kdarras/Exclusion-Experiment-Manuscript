<p>Bird and bat communities were sampled in July 2014 with sound recorders attached to the centra oil palm, and fitted with one acoustic and one ultrasound microphone (SM2Bat+ recorder, SMX-II and SMX-US microphones, Wildlife Acoustics). We recorded in WAV format and used a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz during the day, and a sampling rate of 192 kHz at night. Morning recordings of 20 minutes length after sunrise were uploaded online (<a href="http://soundefforts.uni-goettingen.de/">http://soundefforts.uni-goettingen.de/</a>) for bird identification. The activity of insectivorous birds was measured as the total duration of all bird calls in minutes, and the activity of insectivorous bats was measured as the total duration of all echolocation calls using the software Audacity.</p><div></div>
