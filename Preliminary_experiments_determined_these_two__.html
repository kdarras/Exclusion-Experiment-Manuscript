<div>Preliminary experiments determined these two attractants were attractive to the majority of ant species present in oil palm plantations but not other arthropods. Each type of attractant was placed at nine random locations (one in each tree, five on the ground) in every exclusion plot on days when toxic baiting was carried out. &nbsp;Flying vertebrate (birds and bats) exclusion was achieved by creating a cage 6 m high around the exclusion plots and enclosing the cage with 35 mm mesh size fish nets. Ant suppression and flying vertebrate exclusion was continuous for one year, from August 2013 until August 2014 in four out of six plots, and from May 2014 to May 2015 for the other two. </div>
