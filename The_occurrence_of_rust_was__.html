<div>The occurrence of “rust” was estimated by analysis of the red and green components of crops of JPEG leaf photographs taken for herbivory measurements after 8 months. One photograph was chosen randomly per tree (sample function in R) and the white balance was adjusted with the white color from the underlying carboard. The crops were twice longer than wide and taken from the greatest leaf portion without holes. The mean of its scaled red and green values were used to compute the red/green leaf area ratio, indicating the proportion of the leaf surface that is red and thus photosynthetically not active</div>
