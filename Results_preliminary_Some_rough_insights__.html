<h1>Results (preliminary)</h1><p>Some rough insights using data with a 6-month delay after exclusion start (we think this is the best way to use the yield data-1 year of data with 6-month delay). The delay takes into account that some trees were not being harvested in the beginning of the experiment, time to improve the effectiveness of exclusion, and the 5-6 months between flowering to yield (Verheye 2010).</p><div></div>
