<h3>Ecosystem functions and services</h3><p>In each of the experiment plots data on four important ecosystem functions and services was collected: herbivory, decomposition, predation and crop yield.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To quantify amount of herbivory in the plots we took photos of four leaflets from four fronds for each palm (16 leaflets per palm) included in the experimental plots. Percentage leaf loss per photo was calculated using ImageJ software and converted to an average leaf loss per palm. These photos were taken twice (using different fronds each time), at five months after exclusion and nine months after exclusion.</p><div></div>
