<h2>Experimental Design</h2><div>Six oil palm plantations were selected in the study area for inclusion in this study. Criteria for the selected plantations were that the trees were 2-3 years old, the majority of the trees had begun fruiting, the plantation management was standard, and the plantation had relatively little slope. Young plantations were used due to height limitations of the experimental plots. Within each plantation we created a full factorial combination of ant and bird exclusion plots (Figure 1). This resulted in four experimental plots per site: control, ant exclusion only, bird exclusion only and both ant and bird exclusion. Each experimental plot was approximately 16 x 16 m encompassing four oil palm trees. Minimum distance between the plantations was 1.2 km (mean = 4.9 km)</div>
