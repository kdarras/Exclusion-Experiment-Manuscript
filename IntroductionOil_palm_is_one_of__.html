<h1>Introduction</h1><p>Oil palm is one of the most rapidly expanding crops in the world, particularly in Malaysia and Indonesia (citations). In Indonesia alone, oil palm plantation crop cover is already at approximately seven million ha and this is going to continue increasing along with increased global demands for oil palm products such as biofuel and cooking oil (citations). Oil palm is also highly profitable, producing three to eight times more oil per hectare that any other oil crop with relatively low labour inputs ï»¿<cite class="ltx_cite" data-bib-text="@article{Barcelos_2015,
