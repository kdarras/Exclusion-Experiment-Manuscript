<h2>Statistical analysis</h2><div></div><p>Ant exclusion effectiveness</p><p>We used linear mixed effect models (LMEs) to determine the effect of ant exclusion (independent of bird/bat exclusion) on ant abundance and species richness in the experimental plots with plantation (experiment site) included as a random effect. &nbsp;To meet assumptions of ant abundance was log transformed prior to analysis. Ant community composition was compared between ant exclusion and non-exclusion plots based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index. Significance tests for differences in community composition were performed using the analysis of similarity test (ANOSIM; Clarke 1993). LMEs and ANOSIM analyses were conducted using the nlme (Pinheiro et al. 2015) and vegan (Oksanen et al. 2015) packages in R 3.2.0 (R Core Team 2015). &nbsp;</p><div></div>
