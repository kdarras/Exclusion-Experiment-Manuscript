<div>Bird, bat and ant exclusion experiments have become prominent for investigating these major animal groupsâ€™ roles in agricultural systems, with a particular focus on predation services. Although results are varied, a number of the experiments have made important conclusions about ecosystems functions and production in the systems studied. &nbsp;For example, Maas et al. (2013) found a 31% reduction in cacao yield when birds and bats were excluded from the palms. However, large scale (more than one palm per exclosure), long term exclusion experiments using both bird/bat and ant exclosures are still rare. Studies including ants, birds and bats are important because they have important intra-guild interactions which can lead to non-additive effects (Maas et al. 2015). &nbsp;In the present study, we established a one year long, large scale full factorial combination of bird/bat and ant exclosures in young oil palm plantations in Sumatra, Indonesia. To comprehensively assess the influence of ants, birds and bats on arthropod communities and associated ecosystem services in oil palm plantations we sampled arthropod communities and measured three key ecosystems services, herbivory, predation and decomposition. We also collected yield data throughout the year to understand if any variation in arthropod communities or ecosystem services alters production.</div>
