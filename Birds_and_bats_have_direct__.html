<div>Birds and bats have direct effects on arthropod communities which can have further cascading effects on vegetation through services such as herbivore suppression, especially in communities that are rich in arthropod predators (Mooney et al. 2010). Bats in particular, in the tropics are less affected by land-use change than birds, and still exert significant predation pressure on arthropods (Maas et al. 2015). While it has already been shown that birds may protect oil palm through decreases in herbivory rate when they are present (Koh, 2008a) the study did not relate the data to the bird diversity present and investigated only very young plants (one year old) - usually more susceptible to pest damage - that were not productive, so that an effect on yield could not be observed (Foster et al. 2011). Overall, experimental and observational studies investigating the predation services of birds and bats and their cascading effects on yield and related ecosystems services have had mixed results, showing negative, null and positive effects (citations).</div>
