<div>Two methods were used to suppress ants in the ant exclusion plots. A 50 cm high aluminum barrier was established surrounding the plot, buried 20 cm beneath the soil and the top of the barrier was cover in insect glue (Tanglefoot, Contech Enterprises Inc., British Columbia). The glue was regularly checked and replaced when needed. &nbsp;We also carried out intensive ant poisoning (toxic baiting five days per week and targeted poisoning of ant nests) during the first month of the experiment and then regular toxic baiting for the duration of the experiment. The regular toxic baiting consisted of placing two types of attractants, sugar and tuna, mixed with the insecticide chlorpyrifos (DursbanTM 200EC, Dow AgriSciences, Jakarta, Indonesia) in the exclusion plots for a minimum of one hour three times per week.</div>
