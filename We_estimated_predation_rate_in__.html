<div>We estimated predation rate in the experimental plots using three different prey sizes. To represent the large prey size we used the dummy caterpillar method (Howe et al. 2009). The dummy caterpillars were made with mixed green and brown modeling clay and the size was modeled on a common species of nettle caterpillar that is known to attach oil palm (Setothosea asigna). &nbsp;Four dummy caterpillars were glued to a leaflet on four different fronds on each oil palm (four caterpillars per palm) and collected 48 hours later. Each caterpillar was defined as predated (visible marks present in the clay) or not (no visible marks present) and missing caterpillars were excluded from analysis. &nbsp;This method was carried out eight months after exclusion. To represent a medium and small prey size we used crickets (Acheta domesticus) and aphids (Aphidoidea sp.) respectively. Four individuals were glued onto a piece of card and then one card was glued to four different fronds on each oil palm (16 individuals per palm for both crickets and aphids). Cards were checked after two hours and each individual was defined as predated (visible marks present, or individual missing) or not (no visible marks present). &nbsp;The dummy caterpillar method was carried out at eight months after exclusion, and the crickets and aphids at 11 months after exclusion.</div>
