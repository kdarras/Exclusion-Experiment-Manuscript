<p>Leaf-litter decomposition was measured using the leaf-litter (hereafter litter) &nbsp;bag technique (Falconer et al. 1933). The litter bags were 20 cm x 20 cm and made from mesh with a 4 mm x 4 mm mesh size. Each litter bag contained a known dry weight (10.0 +/- 0.05 g) of oil palm leaves. Fresh leaves were collected from an oil palm plantation close to the experiment sites and then air dried to a constant weight before being cut to a constant length and put into the bags. Four litter bags were placed at random points within each experimental plot. After three months the litter bags were collected and remaining contents was air dried and weighed. Initial weight minus weight at three months determined the amount of decomposition (mass loss).</p><div></div>
