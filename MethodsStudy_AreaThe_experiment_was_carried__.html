<h1>Methods</h1><h2>Study Area</h2><div>The experiment was carried out in the Batanghari Regency of Jambi Province, Sumatra, Indonesia. This area is typical of lowland Sumatra in that it has undergone extensive deforestation, especially over the past 50 years as a result of the increasing expansion of agricultural land. In particular, over the past 20 years oil palm has become one of the most dominant crops in the Province, increasing almost 4-fold from 150,000 ha to 550,000 in the period from 1996 to 2011 (Gatto et al. 2014).</div>
