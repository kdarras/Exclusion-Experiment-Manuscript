<h3>Simple power analysis</h3><p>From the start of the experiment, it was clear that the challenge lies in the yield variation, possibly making it impossible to detect differences between treatments.</p><div></div><p>Here we calculated the power of detecting a difference in yield/effect size of 10% based on the two measures of yield that we currently use:</p><ul><li><p>cumulative (total) yield per tree, 6 month delay after experiment start<br></p></li><li><p>cumulative (total) yield per tree, 6 month delay after experiment start, divided by harvest time<br></p></li></ul><p>I used the overall mean and standard deviation for these variables, across all sites (6) and treatments (4) for 4 replicates (we have 4 trees per site and treatment). We can do a finer analysis with unequal samples and variances but for the moment the result is uneuivocal: we have too much variation in yield, even when using number of samples = 24:</p><div></div>
