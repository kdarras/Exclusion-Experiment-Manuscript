<p>Arthropods, ecosystem functions and yield responses to ant and flying vertebrate exclusion</p><div>We used LMEs to determine the effect of treatment on all response variables; spider abundance, spider species richness, total arthropod abundance excluding ants (hereafter, “arthropod abundance”), taxon richness excluding ants (hereafter, “taxon richness”), predation rate (aphids, crickets and dummy caterpillars), herbivory rate, decomposition (mass loss) and total yield divided by time harvested (hereafter, “yield”). In all models oil palm initial height, soil pH and soil clay content were included as covariates and plantation was included as a random effect. Oil palm initial height, soil pH and soil clay content were included as explanatory variables in the model due to each being important for most response variables and preliminary analysis determined there were significant differences between treatments within sites (Appendix 1, Table S1). When LMEs contained a significant effect of treatment on the response variable, we performed a Tukey post-hoc test (with Bonferroni correction) to test for significant pair-wise differences among treatments. To meet assumptions of normality, spider and arthropod abundance were log transformed prior to analysis. LMEs and post-hoc tests were conducted using the nlme (Pinheiro et al. 2015) and multcomp (Hothorn et al. 2008) packages in R 3.2.0 (R Core Team 2015). &nbsp;</div>
