In Indonesia alone, oil palm plantation crop cover is already at approximately seven million ha and this is going to continue increasing along with increased global demands for oil palm products such as biofuel and cooking oil (citations). Oil palm is also highly profitable, producing three to eight times more oil per hectare that any other oil crop with relatively low labour inputs (Barcelos et al. 2015). However, even with the growing importance of oil palm, research investigating ecosystem functions and services in oil palm plantations is still limited (Foster et al. 2011) and therefore urgently needed to understand the long-term consequences and sustainability of the rapid expansion of this crop.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall the ecological impacts of conversion from rainforest to oil palm are negative, with almost all organisms studied thus far showing a decrease in biodiversity from forest to oil palm (Fitzherbert et al. 2008; Foster et al. 2011; Barnes et al. 2014). More importantly, this biodiversity loss is often non-random, with forest specialists and certain functional groups such as predators being particularly threatened, endangering ecosystem functioning (Denmead et al. , Fitzherbert et al. 2008). For example, Fitzherbert et al. (2008) found that across all taxa an average of only 15% of forest species also occur in oil palm plantations. &nbsp;However, there are certain features of oil palm plantations that can impact the amount of biodiversity able to persist in the plantations such as landscape context and plantation management. For example, increased weed cover and epiphyte presence had positive impacts on butterflies and birds respectively oil palm plantations in Sabah, Malaysia (Koh 2008) and these plantation features are strongly dependent on plantation management. The primary reason for management options such as epiphyte or total weed removal in oil palm plantations is to make harvesting easier (although some farmers do incorrectly assume epiphytes are parasitic) (Koh 2008) and therefore accepted practices such as these are unlikely to change for increased biodiversity alone. &nbsp;However, if there is any relationship between biodiversity and yield and/or any beneficial ecosystem services this might alter a farmer’s willingness to change.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ants dominate terrestrial biomass (Lach et al. 2010) and although communities are altered by disturbance they can still maintain high abundance and species richness in agricultural systems (Folgarait 1998; Rubiana et al. 2015). Ants are important for a number of ecosystem services that are crucial in agriculture systems such as predation (biocontrol), soil aeration and nutrient cycling (Folgarait 1998; Vandermeer et al. 2002). Ants also influence overall community composition in an ecosystem due to their sheer voracity, mutualisms with other animals and plants, and their dominance altering species interactions (Folgarait 1998; Gaume et al. 1998; Lach et al. 2010). Therefore, ants can indirectly affect many other ecosystem processes. &nbsp;In oil palm plantations in Indonesia, ant species richness and abundance can be similar to or more than in lowland rainforest, however few species are shared between them and therefore community composition is drastically altered (Rubiana et al. 2015). In particular, ant species from higher trophic guilds decline from forest to oil palm (Denmead et al. unpublished). &nbsp;Therefore, although ants remain dominant and likely play an important part in oil palm plantations, their influence on the community and certain ecosystem processes may be altered. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Birds and bats have direct effects on arthropod communities which can have further cascading effects on vegetation through services such as herbivore suppression, especially in communities that are rich in arthropod predators (Mooney et al. 2010). Bats in particular, in the tropics are less affected by land-use change than birds, and still exert significant predation pressure on arthropods (Maas et al. 2015). While it has already been shown that birds may protect oil palm through decreases in herbivory rate when they are present (Koh, 2008a) the study did not relate the data to the bird diversity present and investigated only very young plants (one year old) - usually more susceptible to pest damage - that were not productive, so that an effect on yield could not be observed (Foster et al. 2011). Overall, experimental and observational studies investigating the predation services of birds and bats and their cascading effects on yield and related ecosystems services have had mixed results, showing negative, null and positive effects (citations).</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bird, bat and ant exclusion experiments have become prominent for investigating these major animal groups’ roles in agricultural systems, with a particular focus on predation services. Although results are varied, a number of the experiments have made important conclusions about ecosystems functions and production in the systems studied. &nbsp;For example, Maas et al. (2013) found a 31% reduction in cacao yield when birds and bats were excluded from the palms. However, large scale (more than one palm per exclosure), long term exclusion experiments using both bird/bat and ant exclosures are still rare. Studies including ants, birds and bats are important because they have important intra-guild interactions which can lead to non-additive effects (Maas et al. 2015). &nbsp;In the present study, we established a one year long, large scale full factorial combination of bird/bat and ant exclosures in young oil palm plantations in Sumatra, Indonesia. To comprehensively assess the influence of ants, birds and bats on arthropod communities and associated ecosystem services in oil palm plantations we sampled arthropod communities and measured three key ecosystems services, herbivory, predation and decomposition. We also collected yield data throughout the year to understand if any variation in arthropod communities or ecosystem services alters production.</p><div></div><h1>Methods</h1><h2>Study Area</h2><p>The experiment was carried out in the Batanghari Regency of Jambi Province, Sumatra, Indonesia. This area is typical of lowland Sumatra in that it has undergone extensive deforestation, especially over the past 50 years as a result of the increasing expansion of agricultural land. In particular, over the past 20 years oil palm has become one of the most dominant crops in the Province, increasing almost 4-fold from 150,000 ha to 550,000 in the period from 1996 to 2011 (Gatto et al. 2014).</p><h2>Experimental Design</h2><p>Six oil palm plantations were selected in the study area for inclusion in this study. Criteria for the selected plantations were that the trees were 2-3 years old, the majority of the trees had begun fruiting, the plantation management was standard, and the plantation had relatively little slope. Young plantations were used due to height limitations of the experimental plots. Within each plantation we created a full factorial combination of ant and bird exclusion plots (Figure 1). This resulted in four experimental plots per site: control, ant exclusion only, bird exclusion only and both ant and bird exclusion. Each experimental plot was approximately 16 x 16 m encompassing four oil palm trees. Minimum distance between the plantations was 1.2 km (mean = 4.9 km)</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two methods were used to suppress ants in the ant exclusion plots. A 50 cm high aluminum barrier was established surrounding the plot, buried 20 cm beneath the soil and the top of the barrier was cover in insect glue (Tanglefoot, Contech Enterprises Inc., British Columbia). The glue was regularly checked and replaced when needed. &nbsp;We also carried out intensive ant poisoning (toxic baiting five days per week and targeted poisoning of ant nests) during the first month of the experiment and then regular toxic baiting for the duration of the experiment. The regular toxic baiting consisted of placing two types of attractants, sugar and tuna, mixed with the insecticide chlorpyrifos (DursbanTM 200EC, Dow AgriSciences, Jakarta, Indonesia) in the exclusion plots for a minimum of one hour three times per week. Preliminary experiments determined these two attractants were attractive to the majority of ant species present in oil palm plantations but not other arthropods. Each type of attractant was placed at nine random locations (one in each tree, five on the ground) in every exclusion plot on days when toxic baiting was carried out. &nbsp;Flying vertebrate (birds and bats) exclusion was achieved by creating a cage 6 m high around the exclusion plots and enclosing the cage with 35 mm mesh size fish nets. Ant suppression and flying vertebrate exclusion was continuous for one year, from August 2013 until August 2014 in four out of six plots, and from May 2014 to May 2015 for the other two. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ants were surveyed monthly in every experimental plot to monitor the effectiveness of the ant suppression methods. We used plastic observation plates with two baits of 2 cm3 of tuna in oil and two sponges saturated with 70% sugar solution attached to sample ant species (Wielgoss et al. 2010). Two plates were put in a random location on the ground in each experimental plot at each plantation. At 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes after placing the plates on the trees the abundance of each ant species present on the plate was recorded. Specimens were collected from each ant species present where possible without disrupting recruitment. All ants collected were identified to genus level (Fayle et al. 2014). We identified specimens to species level where possible and assigned the remainder to morphospecies. Ant species abundance at a given plot each month was defined as the mean of the maximum number of each species on each plate used at an exclusion plot.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bird and bat communities were sampled in July 2014 with sound recorders attached to the centra oil palm, and fitted with one acoustic and one ultrasound microphone (SM2Bat+ recorder, SMX-II and SMX-US microphones, Wildlife Acoustics). We recorded in WAV format and used a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz during the day, and a sampling rate of 192 kHz at night. Morning recordings of 20 minutes length after sunrise were uploaded online (<a href="http://soundefforts.uni-goettingen.de/">http://soundefforts.uni-goettingen.de/</a>) for bird identification. The activity of insectivorous birds was measured as the total duration of all bird calls in minutes, and the activity of insectivorous bats was measured as the total duration of all echolocation calls using the software Audacity.</p><h2>Sampling methods</h2><h3>Environmental Variables</h3><p>At the experimental plots we measured three variables which may vary between and within sites and influence our experiment response variables (arthropods, ecosystem functions and yield) to be included as covariates in our analysis: soil pH, soil texture and initial palm height (Supplementary methods, Appendix 1).</p><p></p><h3>Arthropod collection and identification</h3><p>The arthropod communities present in the oil palms were sampled intensively after one year of exclusion through three survey methods: insecticide spraying, beating and vacuuming. All methods were completed at one experimental plot before moving to the next. First we lay four 0.9 m x 2.9 m white sheets on the ground, at right angles to the trunk of each oil palm, at each of four points around the palm. This was done for all palms within one experimental plot at one time. One person then walked around the palms twice spraying the insecticide (Decis ® 2,5 EC, Bayer CropScience, Jakarta, Indonesia) extensively over each palm using a herbicide sprayer. After 15 min all invertebrates that had fallen onto the sheets were collected. &nbsp;The walking pattern, amount of time spraying and amount of insecticide used was consistent between plots. Next, the beating method was completed by holding a 5 m x 3 m sheet under a oil palm frond and shaking the frond up and down so arthropods on the frond dropped onto the sheet. This was completed at four fronds on one palm, then the sheet was folded to prevent arthropod escape. The sheet was slowly unfolded on the ground and all arthropods that had dropped onto the sheet were collected. Finally, arthropods in the oil palm leaf axils and flowers were collected with a modified vacuum. Vacuuming was carried out for four minutes per palm which was sufficient time to cover the entire area. The material collected by the vacuum was searched in the lab and all arthropods found were collected. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All invertebrates collected by the three sampling methods were identified to higher taxonomic groups and assigned to feeding guilds. All ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) collected were identified as explained for the monthly ant surveys above. Spiders were also further identified to family (Jocqué and Dippenaar-Schoeman 2006) and then morphospecies. </p><div></div><h3>Ecosystem functions and services</h3><p>In each of the experiment plots data on four important ecosystem functions and services was collected: herbivory, decomposition, predation and crop yield.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To quantify amount of herbivory in the plots we took photos of four leaflets from four fronds for each palm (16 leaflets per palm) included in the experimental plots. Percentage leaf loss per photo was calculated using ImageJ software and converted to an average leaf loss per palm. These photos were taken twice (using different fronds each time), at five months after exclusion and nine months after exclusion.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leaf-litter decomposition was measured using the leaf-litter (hereafter litter) &nbsp;bag technique (Falconer et al. 1933). The litter bags were 20 cm x 20 cm and made from mesh with a 4 mm x 4 mm mesh size. Each litter bag contained a known dry weight (10.0 +/- 0.05 g) of oil palm leaves. Fresh leaves were collected from an oil palm plantation close to the experiment sites and then air dried to a constant weight before being cut to a constant length and put into the bags. Four litter bags were placed at random points within each experimental plot. After three months the litter bags were collected and remaining contents was air dried and weighed. Initial weight minus weight at three months determined the amount of decomposition (mass loss).</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We estimated predation rate in the experimental plots using three different prey sizes. To represent the large prey size we used the dummy caterpillar method (Howe et al. 2009). The dummy caterpillars were made with mixed green and brown modeling clay and the size was modeled on a common species of nettle caterpillar that is known to attach oil palm (Setothosea asigna). &nbsp;Four dummy caterpillars were glued to a leaflet on four different fronds on each oil palm (four caterpillars per palm) and collected 48 hours later. Each caterpillar was defined as predated (visible marks present in the clay) or not (no visible marks present) and missing caterpillars were excluded from analysis. &nbsp;This method was carried out eight months after exclusion. To represent a medium and small prey size we used crickets (Acheta domesticus) and aphids (Aphidoidea sp.) respectively. Four individuals were glued onto a piece of card and then one card was glued to four different fronds on each oil palm (16 individuals per palm for both crickets and aphids). Cards were checked after two hours and each individual was defined as predated (visible marks present, or individual missing) or not (no visible marks present). &nbsp;The dummy caterpillar method was carried out at eight months after exclusion, and the crickets and aphids at 11 months after exclusion.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plantation owners collected fruit following their normal schedule and at collection the fruit was weighed to gain an estimate of yield. Yield measurements continued throughout the experiment and six months after exclusion ended. A number of palms in the experimental plots had not started being harvested at the beginning of our experiment, and it is likely there would be delay for any treatment effects on yield, therefore, we calculated four yield measurements for each tree to be included in our analysis: total yield over the complete 18 months (18m yield), total yield divided by time harvested (18m yield/time), total yield but with a six month delay (12m yield) and total yield with six month delay divided by time harvested (12m yield/time). A six month delay was chosen due to oil palm having 5-6 months between flowering and yield (Verheye 2010).</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The occurrence of “rust” was estimated by analysis of the red and green components of crops of JPEG leaf photographs taken for herbivory measurements after 8 months. One photograph was chosen randomly per tree (sample function in R) and the white balance was adjusted with the white color from the underlying carboard. The crops were twice longer than wide and taken from the greatest leaf portion without holes. The mean of its scaled red and green values were used to compute the red/green leaf area ratio, indicating the proportion of the leaf surface that is red and thus photosynthetically not active</p><div></div><h2>Statistical analysis</h2><div></div><p>Ant exclusion effectiveness</p><p>We used linear mixed effect models (LMEs) to determine the effect of ant exclusion (independent of bird/bat exclusion) on ant abundance and species richness in the experimental plots with plantation (experiment site) included as a random effect. &nbsp;To meet assumptions of ant abundance was log transformed prior to analysis. Ant community composition was compared between ant exclusion and non-exclusion plots based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index. Significance tests for differences in community composition were performed using the analysis of similarity test (ANOSIM; Clarke 1993). LMEs and ANOSIM analyses were conducted using the nlme (Pinheiro et al. 2015) and vegan (Oksanen et al. 2015) packages in R 3.2.0 (R Core Team 2015). &nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Arthropods, ecosystem functions and yield responses to ant and flying vertebrate exclusion</p><p>We used LMEs to determine the effect of treatment on all response variables; spider abundance, spider species richness, total arthropod abundance excluding ants (hereafter, “arthropod abundance”), taxon richness excluding ants (hereafter, “taxon richness”), predation rate (aphids, crickets and dummy caterpillars), herbivory rate, decomposition (mass loss) and total yield divided by time harvested (hereafter, “yield”). In all models oil palm initial height, soil pH and soil clay content were included as covariates and plantation was included as a random effect. Oil palm initial height, soil pH and soil clay content were included as explanatory variables in the model due to each being important for most response variables and preliminary analysis determined there were significant differences between treatments within sites (Appendix 1, Table S1). When LMEs contained a significant effect of treatment on the response variable, we performed a Tukey post-hoc test (with Bonferroni correction) to test for significant pair-wise differences among treatments. To meet assumptions of normality, spider and arthropod abundance were log transformed prior to analysis. LMEs and post-hoc tests were conducted using the nlme (Pinheiro et al. 2015) and multcomp (Hothorn et al. 2008) packages in R 3.2.0 (R Core Team 2015). &nbsp;</p><h1>Results</h1><p>Ant exclusion effectiveness</p><p>Average ant abundance over the year of the experiment was significantly lower in ant exclusion plots, whereas total species richness was not (Table Figure S2). However, community composition was significantly different between ant exclusion and non-ant exclusion plots (ANOSIM, P=0.04, R=0.11).</p><p></p><p>Arthropods, ecosystem functions and yield responses to ant and flying vertebrate exclusion</p><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><h3></h3><h3>Variables in play</h3><p>We know the main effects in our system (the relevant data are indicated in brackets):</p><p><a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/documents/edit/580c3e95-0125-482b-9749-e3b825aed3fd/0?callback=close&amp;v=1120&amp;s=612"><img></a></p><p>Here is another chart of the variables at hand:</p><p><img></p><h3>Simple power analysis</h3><p>From the start of the experiment, it was clear that the challenge lies in the yield variation, possibly making it impossible to detect differences between treatments.</p><div></div><p>Here we calculated the power of detecting a difference in yield/effect size of 10% based on the two measures of yield that we currently use:</p><ul><li><p>cumulative (total) yield per tree, 6 month delay after experiment start<br></p></li><li><p>cumulative (total) yield per tree, 6 month delay after experiment start, divided by harvest time<br></p></li></ul><p>I used the overall mean and standard deviation for these variables, across all sites (6) and treatments (4) for 4 replicates (we have 4 trees per site and treatment).
